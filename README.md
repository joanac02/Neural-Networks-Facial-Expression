# Neural-Networks-Facial-Expression
 
* Facial expression recognition (FER) is a specialized area of computer vision that involves the detection, analysis and classification of facial expressions to infer emotional states, intentions and cognitive processes from images or videos.

* With the growing amount of visual data available and the advancement of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), it has become possible to create more accurate and efficient models for recognizing facial expressions. The main goal is to integrate these models into various real-world applications, significantly improving the way we interact with technology.

* This study aims to recreate an ERF model in real time, focusing on the definition of a classification model based on CNN. The possible use of pre-trained models (TransferLearning) and the use of various data pre-processing scenarios are discussed. It is also intended to implement the best scenario in a model for facial emotion recognition in real time, using OpenCV.

* The dataset chosen is available on the Kaggle platform and is called the "Face Expression Recognition Dataset". It contains thousands of images of faces, labeled with one of several possible facial expressions: happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, neutral, disgust or fear.

* The most effective scenario combines undersampling and the exclusion of a minority class. The application of the model in real time proved successful.
